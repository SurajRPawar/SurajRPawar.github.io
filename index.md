Howdy ! I am a PhD student under Prof Raul Longoria at The University of Texas at Austin. My [research](https://sites.utexas.edu/longoria/system-modeling-estimation-and-control-for-cardiovascular-systems-with-mechanical-circulatory-support/) focuses on estimation of physiological parameters and control of a Left Ventricular Assist Device. Other research interests include :
* Control and Estimation of stochastic dynamical systems
* System modeling
* Hardware-in-loop testing for cyber-physical Systems

When I am not working, I like to [sing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYewUFOsCTZMeMXMcURmbag), or click [photos](https://www.instagram.com/surajpawarclicks/).
